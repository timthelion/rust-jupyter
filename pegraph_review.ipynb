The simplest is to use the [`Graph`](https://docs.rs/petgraph/0.4.13/petgraph/graph/struct.Graph.html) data type. `Graph`s can be either Directed or Undirected. (Note: Graphs are stored the same way whether they are Directed or Undirected. All graphs are stored internally as directed graphs. The only difference is the behavior of some algorithms such as the shortest path algorithms. )\n",

    "One constant of computer science is that data structures that are simple are used far more frequently than those which are complex. I started this article by claiming that graphs are the universal data structure. I went on to show how a the petgraph library can represent any datastructure from a variable, to a list, to a table, to a tree, to a dictionary/hashmap. All of these data structures, however, exist in far more efficent forms either directly as built in types in rust, or as provided in third party libraries. If you need to represent a list, tree or a table and nothing else, you should **never** use petgraph to do so. You should always use the most limited possible data structure which is capable of representing your data because doing so allows your compiler and typechecker to help you prevent bugs. If you write a function that takes a tree and does something with it, and it's type signature looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn cut_tree(tree: Tree) -> Stump {\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you only need to test your function for various possible trees that could be given to that function. The type checker will ensure that only trees are passed to that function, and you do not need to wory about edge cases where something other than a tree might have been passed to it. But if your type signature looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn cut_tree(tree: Graph) -> Stump {\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to test for all sorts of data structures that aren't trees in order to be sure that your program will behave correctly and will not crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest, and therefore most common type of data structure that you actually need the power of petgraph to represent is called a **DAG** or **D**irected **A**cyclic **G**raph. DAGs are a lot like trees but their branches can merge.\n",

    "- **POSIX file trees**: At a low level, the POSIX file system is implemented as a DAG. I know, we refer to the directory hierarchy as a file *tree*, but hard links allow for the merging of branches which makes them not trees in all cases. Since hard links can only be used to link two files, and not directories, cycles cannot be formed. At a higher level, if you take symlinks (which are actually just a special kind of file) into account, file trees are not even DAGs, but generalized graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependency graphs**: Traditional package managers in which  packages depend on one another, end up representing a DAG of packages. You cannot have cycles in such a graph, because the package manager never installs a package before it's dependencies have been installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Makefiles**: Makefiles are another case of doing steps which depend on eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **init system services**: In init systems such as sysv init and systemd the same property applies, that you start services who's dependencies have started first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rust struct declarations**: In rust, the structs which you have declared form a DAG. They cannot form a cycle because rust needs to know how large a struct within a struct is at compile time. This can be worked around by including pointers/references to other structs rather than including them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Git commits**: Just the vocabulary of `branches` should suggest that there is a tree of git commits, but the existance of `merge` commits means that we're working with a DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IPFS nodes**: In IPFS, which is a distributed Hashed DAG there are no cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are DAGs so common?\n",
    "-----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two properties at play here which make DAGs extremely usefull in computer science. The first is `watershedding`. Watershedding is the idea that some regions of your graph are clearly isolated from others. Remember the origional dag I mentioned?"

I mentioned earlier that the values associated with edges in petgraph are called `weights` rather than `labels` as is done elsewhere.
